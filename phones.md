# Before You Buy
There are two main questions that must be considered with buying a phone from China:
 1. Is it compatible with my carrier?
 2. What shipping method should I choose?

Not all phones are compatible with all phone carriers (e.g. AT&T, T-Mobile, etc). This is especially problematic for Americans buying Chinese phones, because often these phones are more targeted for European markets. The actual reason(s) for this may be because America has strange cellular bands or because Chinese companies do not have enough market presence in America to care. Either way, **you must check for band compatibility for the phone you want before you buy it** or you'll run into problems with 3G/4G not working.

Use services like [willmyphonework.net](https://willmyphonework.net/) and [frequencycheck.com](https://www.frequencycheck.com/) to check for band compatibility on phones.

As for shipping, spending $10-$20 extra for insured shipping with tracking such as DHL or EMS is recommended, especially when expensive $100-$600 phones are being shipped overseas. 

If you live in the USA, you don't have to worry about being taxed for importing products overseas unless you're [importing over $800 of goods](https://www.export.gov/article?id=Duties-and-Taxes-eCommerce-Guide-2) For other places in the world, that number (referred to as *De Minimis Value*) is far lower, typically around [0-200 USD.](https://global-express.org/assets/files/Customs%20Committee/de-minimis/GEA%20overview%20on%20de%20minimis_28%20March%202018.pdf) It may be beneficial to message a seller to declare that the phone is a "$20 mp3 player" on the package in order to avoid paying taxes. 

On an unrelated note: If you live in the USA you *may* have issues with [importing products with a price above $130](https://www.reddit.com/r/RepLadies/comments/bjoj4h/help_superbuy_parcel_value_declarations_to_us/), while legally you can go up to $800 without issue, take this in consideration.

# About Mediatek
Mediatek is a Chinese semiconductor company that creates many SoCs (System on a Chip) for phones. They are often found on many budget (sub-$200) and ultra-budget (sub-$100) phones. Whilst their performance is typically slightly inferior to its Qualcomm Snapdragon (American semiconductor company) counterparts, It is common advice on /csg/ to **avoid Mediatek devices**, mainly due to two reasons:
1. Power consumption is signifcantly worse compared to Snapdragon; Snapdragon phones have better battery life in comparison
2. [Mediatek does not release kernel source code for their chipsets](https://www.xda-developers.com/mediatek-source-code-release-no-plans/); Rarely will you see custom roms or root(ing) support for Mediatek phones because of this.

Custom roms and rooting are outside the scope of this guide, but they greatly extend the life of your device. Custom roms can get updates when official updates stop, allow for a large amount of system-level customization. If it were not for this, Mediatek would be far more popular than it currently is within the budget phone community.

# About LeEco
LeEco used to make budget and mid-range smartphones but as of mid-2017 they have left the smartphone market. This is most likely because in May 2017 the company began to succumb to financial issues and in July 2017, [LeEco's president fled China after Chinese legal courts froze his assets](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&biw=1680&bih=950&tbm=nws&ei=lAwQXcL4FI6v5wLmpLGwCQ&q=Jia+Yueting+&oq=Jia+Yueting+&gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i299k1.416.416.0.690.1.1.0.0.0.0.106.106.0j1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.1.106....0.-XwanivCwaA. Their phones can be had for fairly cheap now but know that their latest phone(s) are from 2017.

# About Xiaomi
Xiaomi is well known for their budget smartphones and are gaining more popularity as of recently for their "flagship killers." They are often compared to Apple and sometimes touted as the "Apple of China." They make more than just smartphones; including shoes, smart watches, smart vacuums, facemasks, backpacks, power banks, and hand tools. Most Xiaomi products are of high quality, with a few notable exceptions such as their very low-end phones and the Mediatek varients of some of their phones. I speculate that their popularity in the United States will increase further as they include better band support for their phones for USA carriers.
