# Terminology
Mostly taken from [Flashlight Wiki](https://flashlightwiki.com/Terminology), other sources are hyperlinked. This is not an exhaustive list.
- Die: The part of the LED that actually produces light. It is usually yellow and protected by a clear dome.
- [Dome](budgetlightforum.com/node/15818): A clear plastic or silicone hemisphere placed over the LED or die with the purpose of increasing the amount of light emitted.
- [Driver](https://www.candlepowerforums.com/vb/showthread.php?247543&p=3148200#post3148200): The electronics between the battery and the LED. Drivers regulate voltage to the LED and provide various light intensity modes and memory functions.
- Electronic Switch: Traditional flashlight switches are ["single pole single throw"](http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/What-is-a-single-pole-single-throw-switch-SPST) (SPST) switches that complete a circuit between the battery and the driver. Electronic switches do not complete a circuit, rather are used to 'tell' the driver to allow power through. The battery and the driver are always 'on,' even when no light is emitted. Electronic switches allow for half presses, click and hold, and other enhanced button inputs that a traditional SPST switch could not. Electronic switches require a small amount of current (referred to as "parasitic drain") even when the flashlight is turned off so that the driver can monitor the switch.
- Emitter: The actual light-emitting part of an LED assembly. May include the LED die, its circuit board, and the dome attached to the LED.
- Flood: Light that is emitted from a flashlight in a wide pattern, as if to 'flood' the scene with light.
- [LED](https://flashlightwiki.com/LED): **L**ight **E**mitting **D**iode, the electronic component on the die that produces light.
- Lumens: A measurement of light output.
- PCB: **P**rinted **C**ircuit **B**oard. A circuit board with electronics soldered to it.
- Pill: The housing for the driver the LED.
- Orange Peel: Referring to the textured surface of a reflector used to smooth out beam perfections.
- O-Ring: A rubber ring placed alongside threads on the body of a flashlight to make the flashlight water and dust resistant.
- PWM - **P**ulse **W**idth **M**odulation. A technique of varying the brightness of an LED by turning it on and off very quickly. Good implementations of PWM are unnoticable by eye, but bad PWM can produce strobing artifacts.
- Ramping: A flashlight mode where the brightness gradually increases or decreases ("ramps" up or down), allowing for the user to select the exact brightness level desired.
- [Reflector](https://www.energizer.com/about-flashlights/how-does-a-flashlight-work): A metallic 'bowl' that rests around the emitter that redirects light rays to allow for more light to be reflected forward. Typically a chromed reflector is used, but cheaper flashlights [with copper-colored "reflectors"](http://budgetlightforum.com/comment/1454411#comment-1454411) serve to do the exact opposite, to prevent light not coming directly from the LED to be emitted out the front of the light.
- Throw: The ability of a flashlight to place light far away, often described as either "flood"-y or "throw"-y, where "throw" or "thrower" refers to light that has a narrow pattern, but high intensity and range (distance).
- UI - **U**ser **I**nterface. The specific combition and order of button presses required to operate the various modes of a flashlight. A popular UI for enthusiast flashlights is [And√∫ril](img/flashlights/anduril_ui.png), but there are others, such as [A6, Biscotti, Bistro, and more.]((http://budgetlightforum.com/node/67518))

# Battery Sizes
For reference, popular [battery sizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_battery_sizes#Lithium-ion_batteries_(rechargeable)) for flashlights are shown below. <br>
<br>
The naming scheme is as follows (taken from Wikipedia):
<blockquote>
The larger rechargeable cells are typically assigned five-digit numbers, where the first two digits are the (approximate) diameter in millimeters, followed by the last three digits indicating the (approximate) height in tenths of millimeters. 
</blockquote>

- 10440 = AAA
- 14500 = AA
- 16340 = CR123
- 18650 = Probably the most popular size for enthusiast flashlights. Larger than AA
- 21700 
- 25500 = C Cell
- 26650 
- 32650 = Larger than a D Cell

# Battery Models

# Sub-10440

These flashlights are strictly keychain-size form factor. Although arguably, some [10440 and 14500 flashlights](#10440-and-14500) may pass for being either EDC or keychain-sized.
