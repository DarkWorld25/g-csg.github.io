The following markdown file is the *new* /CSG/ infographic! Featuring:
 - Contributing
 - Clickable links! (actually, this was always a feature)
 - Lightweight size! (for now until images are added)
 - Better viewing on mobile! (unverified)
 - **A constant state of incompleteness!**

## Main Goals:
 - Should look good on mobile
 - Top header (or "navigation bar") for different sections

## Stretch Goals
 - dark theme 

## Issues
 - Can't use collapsible menus via HTML (works but renders oddly)
 - Needs vertical space for individual product overviews

## Notes for Contributors
 - Make sure to 'force reload' in browser to see changes
 -[This markdown editor](https://dillinger.io/) may be useful, but does not support HTML rendering
 - Use `<br>` for line breaks
 - Don't use [collapsable menus](https://gist.github.com/joyrexus/16041f2426450e73f5df9391f7f7ae5f#file-readme-md), they do not render properly
