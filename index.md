 - Contributing
 - Clickable links! (actually, this was always a feature)
 - Lightweight size! (for now until images are added)
 - Better viewing on mobile! (unverified)

## Main Goals:
 - look good on mobile
 - easy for community contributors

## Stretch Goals
 - dark "theme" or css 
 - Top header (or "navigation bar") for different sections

## Issues
 - Can't use collapsible menus via HTML (works but renders oddly)

## Notes for Contributors
 - Make sure to 'force reload' in browser to see changes
 -[This markdown editor](https://dillinger.io/) may be useful, but does not support HTML rendering
 - Use `<br>` for line breaks
 - Don't use [collapsable menus](https://gist.github.com/joyrexus/16041f2426450e73f5df9391f7f7ae5f#file-readme-md), they do not render properly

 1. Fork this project (make a local copy for yourself)
 2. Commit changes with comments (make changes to the copy)
 3. Test output with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
 4. Send a pull request (send it back to the main project)

If you'd rather send me a message, ideas, or don't want to learn Git, you can alternatively email me (the maintainer) at brian@420blaze.it
