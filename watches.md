While there are Chinese brands and watches priced higher than this from brands such as Celadon an Beijing Watch Factory, you best do your own research before spending that amount of money.  
It's also worth noting that nearly all microbrand watches are manufactured in China. including a majority that say _Swiss Made_.



**__Chinese watches and original designs__**

*Very few Chinese watch designs priced below $600 are anything but copies of other watches, sometimes multiple jammed together.
*"Marina Militare" is trademarked by Richemont SA meaning that a vast majority of watch forums see them just the same as a replica and ban the sale of them.
So called _homages_ from Corgeut and Panis are essentially replicas with different branding. Very high bang per buck but disliked by some, in some places even by customs.
