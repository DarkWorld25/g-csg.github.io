## OneOdio Studio Pro-10
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="img/headphones/oneodio_studio_pro-10.png"></p>

Decent sounding headphones for the price. Supports both 3.5mm and 1/4-inch jacks and typically comes with good cables for both. Hinges and build quality are adequate. Pads are abover-average in comfort. Isolation is nothing special.
