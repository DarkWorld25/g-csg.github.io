# Microcontroller Brands

The features of a microcontroller is largely dependant on its use case; It would be impractical to blindly recommend specific microcontrollers. Instead, this is a non-exhaustive list of chinese microcontroller brands, some of which have created unique products (or product families) built off already existing technologies such as Arduino.

# Microcontroller Brands
1. [WAVGAT](#wavgat)
2. [WeMos](#wemos)
3. [Funduino](#funduino)
4. [Geekcreit](#geekcreit)

<TODO: include small discussion about different families of microcontrollers and their features (e.g. ESP8266, ATmega, etc)>

# Single Board Computer Brands

For the same reasons as the #[Microcontroller Brands](#microcontroller-brands) section, it would not be very practical to simply list every Single-Board Computer (SBC) offered by Chinese companies, instead just the brands are listed. Future plans for this project may discuss minimum and recommended spec'd specific SBC's for running software such as [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/), [pfsense](https://www.pfsense.org/), [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/) [Videogame Console Emulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/), and other various [Homelab](#https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/) uses.
