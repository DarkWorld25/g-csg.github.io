# Soldering Irons
Soldering is an invaluable aspect of electronics engineering, and a craftsman is only as good as his tools.

## "New" vs "Old" type.
Budget/Chinese soldering stations and irons have somewhat recently transitioned into a new style with the popularity of JBC irons and the near-legendary Hakko FX-951, which implements an integrated tip.
The tip of the iron is a long rod that has the heater, temperature sensor and tip element all in one. All of the power delivery is done through there, with some contacts at the bottom to receive power from the iron.

Old iron types have a fixed heating element in the form of a ceramic core that makes contact with a sleeve to transfer into a separate tip piece.

A detailed video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scvS2yeUH00).

The editor of this section almost certainly recommends that you get an iron of the new pattern, as tip availability is still good ("T12" stations can take genuine Hakko T12 or T15 tips along with Chinese copies), and the advantages of temperature pickup, accuracy, retention and efficiency will outclass almost any old-pattern iron, regardless of how much power it spits out.


## Ceramic heater "old" type.
There are a lot of OEMs and similar irons with different brand names or labelling. Here are a few irons:

[Eruntop 60W](#eruntop-60w)
[Yihua 947](#yihua-947)
[Aoyue 469](#aoyue-469)
[Yihua 937D](#yihua-937d)

### Eruntop 60W

Usually comes with no name, this is a popular blue soldering iron that plugs straight into AC. The shitty potentiometer only regulates voltage, no actual temperature regulation.
This is the cheapest of anything under the sun, aim a little higher.

5-10 USD.

### Yihua 947

What appears to be a slightly "upgraded" variant of the former.

10-15 USD.

### Aoyue 469

### Yihua 937D

This seems to be one of the better "old" type stations from China, as bulky as it is. There is also a "+" variant that is higher wattage.
~30-40 USD

## Integrated tip "new" type.

This ain't your grandpa's RadioShack iron.
Some of the "T12" stations have DIY variants where you can put together and solder a soldering station. Such is the miracle of life.

[KSGER T12](#ksger-t12)
[TS100](#ts100)
[TS80](#ts80)
[STC T12](#stc-t12)

### KSGER T12
A popular "smart" station that's powered with an STM32 controller with all of the bells and whistles. OLED Screen with proper menu, power readout, sleep mode, "boost" mode, and some other stuff.

Also has an option for accurately selecting tips/calibrating tips that are Hakko or otherwise not KSGER's to get accurate temperature, and with preset profiles (for KSGER tips) and profiles to save custom tip calibrations.

KSGER's official store sells multiple irons/handles, so you can pick the one you prefer aesthetically/ergonomically.

Powered with IEC (3 pin PC PSU) cable and with in-line fuse. The PSU inside the unit is well made.
KSGER's official store is on Aliexpress, BangGood units MAY be unofficial.

The station also has a "mini" variant that has no power supply and is instead powered with a 24V, 5A barrel jack. Much thinner, if that's your thing.

30-50 USD depending on configuration.

### TS100
A pen-based soldering iron with an OLED menu that takes a barrel jack connection. A very good portable iron.

~50 USD.

### TS80
Similar as above but takes a Quick Charge 3 USB-C connection. Convenient approach if you have a QC3 power bank and do soldering out often.
Usually more expensive, 70 USD or so.

### STC T12
A T12 station with a dumber microcontroller and alarm clock segment display.

# Microcontroller Brands

The features of a microcontroller is largely dependent on its use case; It would be impractical to blindly recommend specific microcontrollers. Instead, this is a non-exhaustive list of chinese microcontroller brands, some of which have created unique products (or product families) built off already existing technologies such as Arduino.

# Microcontroller Brands
1. [WAVGAT](#wavgat)
2. [WeMos](#wemos)
3. [Funduino](#funduino)
4. [Geekcreit](#geekcreit)

<TODO: include small discussion about different families of microcontrollers and their features (e.g. ESP8266, ATmega, etc)>

# Single Board Computer Brands

For the same reasons as the #[Microcontroller Brands](#microcontroller-brands) section, it would not be very practical to simply list every Single-Board Computer (SBC) offered by Chinese companies, instead just the brands are listed. Future plans for this project may discuss minimum and recommended spec'd specific SBC's for running software such as [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/), [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/), [pfsense](https://www.pfsense.org/), [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/) [Videogame Console Emulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/), and other various [Homelab](#https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/) uses.
