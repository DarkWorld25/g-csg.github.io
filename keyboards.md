# Mechanical Switches

Most modern mechanical Cherry MX-style switches come in three flavours:
1. [Linear](#linear)
2. [Tactile](#tactile)
3. [Clicky](#clicky)

Where the three refer to the tactility and sound profile of the switch when pressed. A linear switch has no additional tactility when fully depressed and the only sounds produced by such is from the switch being fully depressed and un-depressed. A tactile switch has a "tactile point" close to the actuation point from when it is un-depressed to being fully depressed. A clicky switch is similar to a tactile switch except clicky switches produce a typically loud 'clicky' sound when the tactile point is actuated. Further reading on the categories of switches can be found in [Additional Resources](#additional-resources).

# Keyboard Sizes
Mechanical keyboards come in a variety of keyboard sizes. Conventional keyboards featuring alphanumeric keys, function keys, navigational keys, and a number pad keys are considered to be "100%" or "Fullsized." Many mechanical keyboards are targeted toward gamers and programmers who may not need the full size of the 100% form factor and as a result a vast majority of mechanical keyboards on the market are smaller than 100%. A short list of keyboard sizes of interest is listed below. Further reading on the sizes of keyboards can be found in [Additional Resources](#additional-resources).

- 100%: A "fullsized" keyboard with alphanumeric keys, modifiers, function keys, navigational keys, and a number pad. May have additional dedicated multimedia keys.
- 96%: A new-and-upcoming layout that features all the keys of a 100% layout, but with no gaps between the navigation cluster and the numpad.
- Tenkeyless: The same layout as a 100% keyboard but without a number pad, with a gap between the navigation cluster, function keys, and alphanumeric and function keys
- 70%: A tenkeyless layout but without the gaps between the navigation cluster, function keys, and alphanumeric keys. As a result the navigation cluster keys are shifted amongst the right hand side of the keyboard.
- 60%: Alphanumeric keys and modifiers. The navigation cluster and function keys are typically accessible via a "function layer" or by using a function key (sometimes labeled "Fn") to access them.
- 40%: Alpha keys and modifiers.

TODO: 
 - expand fullsized, 
 - add "premium" models (ducky, varmillo, lepold) 
 - add "chinese premium" (plum, noppoo, ikbc, NiZ)
 - add text about custom keyboards
 - add keycap materials information (or table)
